# Multiverse News Network

Welcome to the Multiverse News Network project! This Node.js application generates creative alternate history scenarios and corresponding news reports, offering a unique glimpse into parallel universes.

## 🌌 Project Overview

The Multiverse News Network is an innovative Node.js application that leverages AI to create and report on alternate history scenarios. It consists of three main components:

1. **Alternate History Agent**: Generates a description of a parallel universe with a divergent historical event.
2. **News Reporter Agent**: Creates a news bulletin based on the alternate universe.
3. **Commentary Agent**: Provides insightful analysis on the alternate reality and its implications.

## 🚀 Features

- Dynamic generation of alternate history scenarios
- AI-powered creation of news reports from parallel universes
- Insightful commentary on alternate realities
- Logging of all generated content for future reference

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Access to an AI model API (e.g., local Ollama instance or other compatible API)

## 🛠 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
